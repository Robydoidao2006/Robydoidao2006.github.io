RPG GAME html5 - March 24. 2018 

Hello, in this series I will be putting together a 2d rgp game.

this will help me keep track of futures implementations and 
will make things easier to test the project from stage 1 to the final project. 


In part one, I was able to..

- use a background map
- add a heroe that can move by clicking inside the area of the background map.
