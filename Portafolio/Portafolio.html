        Robert Fialho is a 27 years old man, who was born in Plantation Florida on October 19, 1990.
    When he was 3 years old, his parents got divorce, and he ended up moving with his dad and sister in Venezuela.
    where he grew up. He managed to learn Portuguese at home, because his dad and stepmother spoke it all the time, 
    and he learned Spanish in school. At the age of 14, his dad and stepmother got divorce and they ended up moving 
    to Brasil. He graduated from high school in Brasil in 2010. After that he moved back to the United States. The little English he 
    knew from watching movies and playing video games was not enough to get things done in the USA. He ended up taking an intensive 
    English course at Florida State University where he spent a year to learn the language. One day he got a call from his older
    brother, he told him he was thinking on opening a business on building mini houses in Portland, OR. That's when he moved 
    Northwest to try something different. The business did not work, and he disliked the cold weather and so he moved back to 
    Florida. He found out about a Full stack bootcamp program and that got his attention, and so he applied for the course november 2017.</p><br><br></div>
